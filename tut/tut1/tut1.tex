To produce a simple \LaTeX{} document is very easy. You just
need to type in the text. To create a new paragraph,
just leave one or more blank lines.

\LaTeX{} will take care of the indentation of each paragraph.
By default, the first paragraph will not be indented in 
a new section. The rest of the paragraphs will be indented
automatically. Take note that if no chapter or section is 
defined, all paragraphs will be indented.

To produce a single quote, use the ` symbol (usually located
under the `Esc' key on the keyboard), and close it with 
the ' symbol (usually located besides the `Enter' key 
on the keyboard).
For double quote, you should use those keys twice. For
example, ``the quoted text''.

\LaTeX{} could produced dashes with various length. 
There are three types of dashes: `hyphens', `en-dashes'
and `em-dashes'. Hyphens are obtained in LATEX by 
typing -, en-dashes by typing -- and em-dashes by 
typing ---.
